			<h3>Embrace Christian Church Vision:</h3>
			<p>
				It is our vision as a christian church minsitry to embrace the community
				based on God's vision and His words which are written in the book of
				life, which translates into the principles which we live by from the
				word of God. We are seeking to reach as many lost souls as possible
				based on our loving, kindness, compassion, giving, forgiving so that we
				all can grow together in one accord.
			</p>

			<p>
				We are currently looking to establish a place of fellowship that we can
				call our own. We currently have our fellowship service at libraries and
				hotel conference rooms which at times we have to follow their schedule
				ir order to reserve space. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we are
				currently using the zoom platform for our fellowship service.
			</p>

			<p>
				We are also seeking to establish a christian learning environment for
				our school age students in the near future, which is much needed in
				today's society. Lets not just talk about it, let's be about it based on
				the plans set forth by God. Just as God had given Nehemiah the vision to
				rebuild the broken walls in Jerusalem (Nehemiah 2:17, 18 NIV), we too
				here at Embrace Christian Church seek to rebuild a broken world one soul
				at a time. God has placed on our hearts to help the homeless. Therefore,
				we are looking to provide food, clothing, shelter and basic needs for
				the homeless. We are currently helping charity organizations (see
				charity list) that help those in need.
			</p>

			<h3>Embrace Christian Church Mission:</h3>
			<p>
				First and foremost, we are all God's people. It is our mission here at
				Embrace Christian Church to teach God's people based on the written and
				spoken words of the bible. It is also our mission to encourage everyone
				to comprehensively teach the word of God. Our beliefs are in the power
				of God through the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Our mission is to help
				those who stand in the needs of physical, emotional and spiritual needs.
				God has placed his people on the earth for their purpose in life so that
				God may be glorified. Therefore, it is our mission to assist all God's
				people to accomplish their purpose in life by the word of God. Join us
				in accomplishing our mission statement that God has placed on our
				hearts. We are a bible based ministry doing the will of God.
